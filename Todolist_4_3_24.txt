1.Convert to moles (Fe data)√

2.Calculate molar ratio OC:Fe√

3.Look at OC:Fe mobilization through time and treatment (use ratio)

4.What size fractions have the largest OC:Fe

5.Apply Fe(III) equation to 254 data
	calculate abs due to Fe3 at 254 using eqn then subtract that from the EEMs 254.

6.OC:Fe @ 254  (OC:Fe, a254) (x,y)

7.gsw package for salinity

8.Update TOC Readme notes with Rainier's lab notebook

9.Make sure columns are correctly read as numeric, character, etc in Stats code
