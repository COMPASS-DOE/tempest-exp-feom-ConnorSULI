Chemical Analysis for Fe-OM mechanism exeriment


Used Ultrameter for conductivity Calibrated to 99.3 uS. Read 99.11 after calibration. 

Rinsed with DI water 3 times. 4 mL of sample was measured and dispensed into the chamber. 

Some samples were volume limited and were therefore diluted by 4x. 1 part sample and 3 parts DI water.

Reported in either uS or mS


4x dilution was decided based upon preliminary testing-
Unfiltered natural sea water was measured (after calibration: 99.3 uS).

The initial conducitivity was then used to calculate % difference between dilutions
Measurements were done in triplicate to get an average
2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 7x diluted

The 4x dilution had the smallest % difference from the undiluted sea water



I used a Firesting GO2 oxygen meter to measure O2%.

Did not use the thermometer attachment but set it for 25 degrees celsius
